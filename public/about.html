<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Now Listen
Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night, I'd like to make my girl
But right now, I can't make ends meet, no
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from that same old, same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist,
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this</p>

<p>They say I spend my money on women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in
I just like my fun every now-and-then
I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get away from that same old, same old
I need a chance just to get away
If you could hear me think this is what I'd say
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time</p>

<p>If you could hear me think this is
You see I, I raise a toast to all of us
Who are breakin' our backs every day
If wanting the good life is such a crime
Lord, then, put me away, yeah
Here's to ya
Mmh, guitar
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
It don't get better, babe</p>
